	Readme for MyChat (Visual Studio 2012)</h1>
<p>
	MyChat is a simple WPF application that demonstrates the usage of the AutoRefreshWrapper
	outlined in <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/233770/AutoRefresh-Entity-Framework-data-using-SQL-Server">
		http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/233770/AutoRefresh-Entity-Framework-data-using-SQL-Server</a>.</p>
<p>
	The program can be started several times on one or different computers. In each 
	instance the user can enter a name and a message and then press the &quot;Send&quot; 
	button. The message will be sent to the database and each instance will be 
	notified about the change and will update the list of messages immediately.</p>
<p>
	Note that you might need to change the database connection by editing the 
	application config (MyChat.exe.config). The default is &quot;.\SQLEXPRESS&quot; 
  or &quot;(localdb)\v11.0&quot;.</p>
<p>
  If the database (named &quot;MyChat.Model.ChatContext&quot; unless changed in 
  MyChat.exe.config) doesn't exist, Code First will create it. Make sure that 
	your database server is configured to work with Service Broker and that you&#39;re 
	using sufficient credentials for login.</p>
